    <strong><p>Delicious Vegetarian Pizza! Perfect for any family gathering</p></strong>
    <p>As a vegetarian for over a decade, I’ve eaten quite a few veggie pizzas. Truly fantastic veggie pizzas are few and far between. So, I combined all of the elements I’ve enjoyed over the years to create my own “ultimate” veggie pizza recipe. This is the best homemade veggie pizza I’ve ever had, and I hope you’ll say the same!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>Baby Spinach</li>
        <li>Part-Skim Mozzarella</li>
        <li>Artichoke</li>
        <li>Bell Pepper</li>
        <li>Red Onion</li>
        <li>Cherry Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Olives</li>
    </ul>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with a rack in the upper third of the oven. If you’re using a baking stone or baking steel, place it on the upper rack. Prepare dough through step 5.</li>
    <li>Spread pizza sauce evenly over the two pizzas, leaving about 1 inch bare around the edges. Evenly distribute the spinach on top of the sauce, followed by the cheese (use all three cups if you want a cheesy pizza as shown here)</li>
    <li>Top the pizzas with artichoke, bell pepper, red onion, tomatoes, olives and almonds (if using).</li>
    <li>Bake pizzas individually on the top rack until the crust is golden and the cheese is golden and bubbly, about 10 to 12 minutes (or significantly less, if you’re using a baking stone/steel—keep an eye on it).</li>
    <li>Transfer pizzas to a cutting board and sprinkle with with fresh basil, red pepper flakes and Parmesan, if using. Slice and serve! Leftover pizza keeps well in the refrigerator for 4 days, or for several months in the freezer.</li>
</ol>
