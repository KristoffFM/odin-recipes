            <li>12 to 16 ounces frozen or refrigerated cheese tortellini</li>
            <li>28 ounce can crushed fire roasted tomatoes (or best quality crushed tomatoes)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>3 cups baby spinach leaves, tightly packed (or chopped spinach)</li>
            <li>8 fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>4 ounce goat cheese log</li>
        </ul>
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the tortellini according to the package instructions (fresh usually takes 2 to 3 minutes and frozen takes 2 to 5 minutes to boil). Then drain it. </li>            
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet, place the crushed tomatoes, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic powder, oregano, kosher salt, spinach, and whole basil leaves. Bring to a simmer, then cover and simmer while the pasta cooks or at least 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the pasta is done and drained, add it to the skillet. Crumble in the goat cheese into the sauce and stir until a creamy sauce forms (if you’d like, save out a few crumbles for topping). Serve immediately.</li>
